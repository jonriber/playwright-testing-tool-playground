Starting playwright end-to-end testing framework, getting started and exploring its features

## Why to use end-to-end testing framework?

Using an end-to-end testing framework like Playwright offers several benefits for web application testing

### Cross-Browser Testing

Playwright allows you to run tests across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) \
ensuring your web application works consistently across different browser environments.

### Cross-Platform Testing

Playwright supports testing on various platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring your application \
functions correctly regardless of the operating system.

### Real User Scenarios

End-to-end tests in Playwright simulate real user interactions such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and \
navigating through the application, providing a comprehensive test of the entire application flow.

### Automation

Playwright enables you to automate testing workflows, saving time and effort by automatically running tests and \
generating reports without manual intervention.

### Debugging Capabilities

Playwright offers detailed debugging capabilities, allowing you to trace test failures, inspect the DOM, and \
identify issues quickly.

### Performance Testing

Playwright can be used to measure the performance of your web application by simulating user interactions under \
different load conditions, helping you identify performance bottlenecks.

### Integration with CI/CD Pipelines

Playwright integrates seamlessly with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, \
enabling automated testing as part of the development workflow

### Maintenance

End-to-end tests help in identifying issues early in the development process, leading to more maintainable code and \
reducing the likelihood of regressions
